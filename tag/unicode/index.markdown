[Unicode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode) is a computing industry standard for the consistent [encoding](/tag/encoding), representation, and handling of text expressed in most of the world's writing systems.

The most commonly used encodings are UTF-8, UTF-16 and the now-obsolete UCS-2. UTF-8 uses one byte for any ASCII character, all of which have the same code values in both UTF-8 and ASCII encoding, and up to four bytes for other characters.
