[OpenSSH](https://www.openssh.com/), also known as OpenBSD Secure Shell, is a suite of security-related network-level utilities based on the SSH protocol, which help to secure network communications via the encryption of network traffic over multiple authentication methods and by providing secure tunneling capabilities. 

OpenSSH was designed as a free and open source alternative to the proprietary SSH implementation developed by Tatu Yl√∂nen and offered by SSH Communications Security.
