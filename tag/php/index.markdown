[PHP](https://php.net/) is a server-side scripting language designed for web development but also used as a general-purpose programming language.

The LAMP architecture has become popular in the web industry as a way of deploying web applications. PHP is commonly used as the `P` in this bundle alongside [Linux](/tag/linux), [Apache](/tag/apache) and [MySQL](/tag/mysql), although the `P` may also refer to Python, Perl, or some mix of the three.
