[Ubuntu](https://www.ubuntu.com/) is a [Debian](https://www.debian.org/)-based [Linux](/tag/linux) operating system, with Unity as its default desktop environment. It is based on free software and named after the Southern African philosophy of ubuntu (literally, "human-ness"), which often is translated as "humanity towards others" or "the belief in a universal bond of sharing that connects all humanity".

Ubuntu's goal is to be secure "out-of-the box". By default user's programs run with low privileges and cannot corrupt the operating system or other user's files.
