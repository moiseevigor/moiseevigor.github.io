[Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux) is a Unix-like and mostly [POSIX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX)-compliant computer operating system assembled under the model of free and open-source software development and distribution. The defining component of Linux is the Linux kernel, an operating system kernel first released on 5 October 1991 by Linus Torvalds

Typically, Linux is packaged in a form known as a Linux distribution, for both desktop and server use. Some popular mainstream Linux distributions include Debian, [Ubuntu](/tag/ubuntu), Linux Mint, Fedora, openSUSE, Arch Linux, and the commercial Red Hat Enterprise Linux and SUSE Linux Enterprise Server.
