[Ceph](https://ceph.com/) is a free software storage platform designed to present object, block, and file storage from a single distributed computer cluster. Ceph's main goals are to be completely distributed without a single point of failure, scalable to the exabyte level, and freely-available. The data is replicated, making it fault tolerant.

[Ceph](https://ceph.com/) software runs on commodity hardware. The system is designed to be both self-healing and self-managing and strives to reduce both administrator and budget overhead.
