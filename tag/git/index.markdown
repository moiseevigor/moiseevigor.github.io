[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is a distributed revision control system with an emphasis on speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows. 

Git was initially designed and developed by Linus Torvalds for [Linux](/tag/linux) kernel development in 2005, and has since become the most widely adopted version control system for software development.
