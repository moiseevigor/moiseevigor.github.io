[JavaScript](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/JavaScript) is a dynamic computer programming language. It is most commonly used as part of web browsers, whose implementations allow client-side scripts to interact with the user, control the browser, communicate asynchronously, and alter the document content that is displayed. 

It is also used in server-side network programming with runtime environments such as Node.js, game development and the creation of desktop and mobile applications.
