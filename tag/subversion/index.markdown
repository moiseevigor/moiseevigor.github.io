[Apache Subversion](http://subversion.apache.org/) (often abbreviated SVN) is a software versioning and revision control system distributed as free software under the Apache License.

Developers use Subversion to maintain current and historical versions of files such as source code, web pages, and documentation. Its goal is to be a mostly compatible successor to the widely used Concurrent Versions System (CVS).
