[Unix](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix) is a family of multitasking, multiuser computer operating systems that derive from the original AT&T Unix.

Many clones of Unix have arisen over the years, of which [Linux](/tag/linux) is the most popular, having overtaken the popularity of "true" Unix on server platforms since its inception in the early 1990s.
