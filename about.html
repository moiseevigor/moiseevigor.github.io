<p>Hi there! I'm an applied mathematician and artificial intelligence practitioner with a passion for exploring the
intersection of human and machine intelligence.</p>

<p>I hold a MSc in Applied Mathematics and am
currently working as a Director of Engineering at <a href="https://standard.ai">Standard.AI</a>, where I focus on developing machine learning algorithms for
various applications.</p>

<p>In my spare time, I enjoy maintaining the <a href="https://code.google.com/p/elliptic/">Elliptic functions for Matlab</a> package, 
which is used by researchers and practitioners in various fields to solve mathematical problems that involves elliptic functions and elliptic integrals. 
I have also contributed to several other open-source projects, which can be found on my GitHub profile (<a href="https://github.com/moiseevigor">github.com/moiseevigor</a>).</p>

<p>My work has been published in leading journals such as <a href="https://www.esaim-cocv.org/articles/cocv/abs/2010/02/cocv0862/cocv0862.html">ESAIM: Control, Optimisation 
  and Calculus of Variations (ESAIM: COCV)</a> and <a href="https://molpharm.aspetjournals.org/content/70/1/373">Molecular Pharmacology (Mol. Pharmacol.)</a>.</p>

<p>When I'm not working, you can find me crossing countries on foot or on my bicycle, reading science fiction books.

<p>In addition, I am also an avid presenter</p>
