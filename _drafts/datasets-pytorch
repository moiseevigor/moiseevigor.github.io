mean and std for CIFAR10 dataset to use in transforms.Normalize
The CIFAR-10 dataset is a widely used dataset for image classification that consists of 60000 32x32 color training images and 10000 test images. The images in the dataset are normalized by subtracting the mean image from every image and dividing by the standard deviation of every image.

The mean and standard deviation of the CIFAR-10 dataset can be computed using the following code:

Copy code
import numpy as np
from torchvision.datasets import CIFAR10

# Load the CIFAR-10 dataset
dataset = CIFAR10(root='./data', download=True)

# Compute the mean and std of the dataset
mean = np.mean(dataset.data, axis=(0, 1, 2)) / 255  # mean image
std = np.std(dataset.data, axis=(0, 1, 2)) / 255  # std image

print(mean)
print(std)
The mean and standard deviation of the CIFAR-10 dataset are approximately:

Copy code
[0.49139968 0.48215841 0.44653091]
[0.24703223 0.24348513 0.26158784]
You can then use these values to normalize the images in the dataset using the torchvision.transforms.Normalize transformation:

Copy code
import torch
from torchvision import transforms

# Define the normalization transform
normalize = transforms.Normalize(mean=mean, std=std)

# Normalize a sample image
image = dataset[0][0]  # get the first image in the dataset
image_normalized = normalize(image)

print(image_normalized)
