Here is a sample one-pager code for training ResNet50 on ImageNet using fastai:

Copy code
# First, we import the necessary libraries
from fastai.vision import *

# Next, we download and unzip the ImageNet dataset
path = untar_data(URLs.IMAGENET_SAMPLE)

# Then, we create a DataBunch object for training and validation
data = (ImageList.from_folder(path)
        .split_by_folder(valid='val')
        .label_from_folder()
        .transform(tfms=get_transforms(), size=224)
        .databunch(bs=64))

# Now, we create a ResNet50 model and load the pretrained weights
learn = cnn_learner(data, models.resnet50, metrics=error_rate)

# We can then fit the model to the data using the fit_one_cycle method
learn.fit_one_cycle(4)

# Finally, we can save the trained model
learn.save('resnet50-trained')
This code will train a ResNet50 model on the ImageNet dataset using fastai's default hyperparameters and data augmentation techniques. The model will be trained for 4 epochs using the fit_one_cycle method, which is a variant of the traditional stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimization algorithm that uses cyclical learning rates. The trained model will then be saved to the resnet50-trained file.

You can customize the code further by specifying different hyperparameters, such as the learning rate and weight decay, or by using different data augmentation techniques. You can also try fine-tuning the model on a different dataset by using the fine_tune method.





To create a Docker image containing the code for training ResNet50 on ImageNet using fastai, you can use the following Dockerfile:

Copy code
FROM python:3.8

# Install fastai and torch
RUN pip install fastai torch

# Copy the training code to the container
COPY train.py /app/train.py

# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Run the training script when the container is started
CMD ["python", "train.py"]
This Dockerfile uses the official Python 3.8 image as the base image and installs the fastai and PyTorch libraries using pip. It then copies the training script (train.py) to the /app directory in the container and sets it as the working directory. Finally, it specifies that the train.py script should be run when the container is started.

To build the Docker image, you can run the following command from the directory containing the Dockerfile:

Copy code
docker build -t resnet50-training .
This will create an image with the tag resnet50-training. You can then run the image using the following command:

Copy code
docker run resnet50-training
This will start a new container based on the resnet50-training image and run the training script inside it.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.
