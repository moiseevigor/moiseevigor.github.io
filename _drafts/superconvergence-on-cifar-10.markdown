In this post I'm trying to explore the superconvergence technique introduced by Leslie Smith from the Naval Research Laboratory, more of it in 
- [Super-Convergence: Very Fast Training of Neural Networks Using Large Learning Rates](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.07120)
- [Training Imagenet in 3 hours for USD 25; and CIFAR10 for USD 0.26](https://www.fast.ai/posts/2018-04-30-dawnbench-fastai.html)
